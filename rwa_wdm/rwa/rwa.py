    function, which in turn returns the lightpath itself upon RWA success. This
    split into two classes is due to the fact that the class instance needs to
    be executed only once, while the callback may be called multiple times
    during simulation, namely one time per number of arriving call times number
    of load in Erlags (calls * loads)
